    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Learn how to bake chicken that's tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Adding just a bit of chicken broth to those beautiful pan drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.</p>
    <h4>How Long to Bake Chicken Breasts</h4>
    <p>It depends on the size of the chicken breasts. Smaller chicken breasts will bake in a shorter amount of time, while larger breasts will take a bit longer. If you use the 5-ounce breasts the recipe calls for, the chicken should be ready after about 25 minutes in the pre-heated oven. When the chicken is done, the juices will run clear and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</p>
    <h4>What Temperature Is Best to Bake Chicken Breasts?</h4>
    <p>We think 400 degrees F is the perfect temperature for baking chicken breasts. That's what this recipe calls for, and it yields perfectly baked results.</p>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).<br><img src="images/chicken-breast-step3.webp" alt="Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes." height="200"></li>
        <li>Remove chicken to a plate. Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.<br><img src="images/chicken-breast-step4.webp" alt="our chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off" height="200"></li>
