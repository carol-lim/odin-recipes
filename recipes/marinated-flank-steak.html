    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from marination.</p>
